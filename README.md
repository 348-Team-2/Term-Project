# Term Project

## Project Description

This project aims to create an arithmetic expression parser component in C++ that will be used in a compiler for the upcoming language "L". The primary objective is to systematically develop this parser and deliver it, along with its related documentation, by May 7th, 2026.

While the core of this project consists of creating the parser demonstrating the functionality will also require computing the output of entered expressions. Input for this project will be taken from the CLI, and output will also be delivered to the CLI representing the output of the artihmetic input by the user.

In summary the project will be able to:  
1. Take an input
2. Convert the input into appropriate tokens.
3. Run correct calculations based on the tokens.
4. Output the results
5. Gracefully handle any errors.


## Documentation

Code documentation is fully done using Doxygen. A pre-configured `Doxyfile` already exists in the repo.
Install Doxygen either via the binary installer on Windows: [Doxygen website](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html), 
or run `sudo apt-get install doxygen` on Linux. Open terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project (you will
see Doxyfile), and run 
```bash 
 doxygen Doxyfile
```
You will find the command generate an html/ and latex/ folder in your project root. Open html/index.html to view the 
documentation.

General documentation is held in this table.
